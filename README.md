It was a nice community addition. If it's broken please open an issue or submit a pull request and I'll take a look. Thank you!  ### Build  To build the Docker image, run: ```shell $ docker build -t scanless . ```  ### Usage  To use the Docker image previously created, run the following with whichever options you want like `--help`: ``` $ docker run --rm -it scanless --help ```  If that long command is too troublesome, you can make an alias like so: `alias scanless="docker run --rm -it scanless"` and then run `scanless` as you would normally: ``` $ scanless --help $ scanless -l $ scanless -t scanme.nmap.org -s yougetsignal ```
